# LoadShedApplication

---------------EXTRA CODE----------------
An example of how to control an Arduino using the serial port on a computer
is attached as well as the code for how the Arduino behaves. This file requires any Arduino
as long as the pins are configured correctly. The circuit is composed of three LED's, a green LED,
red LED, and Blue LED. 

The name of the sample code I created for this project is: GUI_Serial_Sample_Ricky
The name of the Arduino program is called: Arduino_Java_Serail

I apoligize for the vague naming conventions :P
